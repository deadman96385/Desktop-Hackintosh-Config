# Desktop High Sierra 10.13 Hackintosh


This entire config would probably work on Mojave as well but I have a Nvidia card as my primary. If i instead switched to the Intel HD 530 it would be fine.

## Hardware
CPU - i7-6700k - 6th Gen

RAM - 16GB - 2 Slots

GPU - EVGA 980 TI and Intel HD 530 (Disabled in BIOS)

Drives - Misc selection of AHCI/Sata SSD's/HDD's

Audio - Realtek ALC1150 (Motherboard Audio)

Motherboard - MSI B150 M3

Ethernet - Killer E2400 (Motherboard Gigabit Ethernet port)

WIFI/BT - Coming Soon

## Software
Used the [Vanilla guide](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) and the [Internet Recovery install method](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/)

## Config.plist (Removed to protect my PC)
Requires Serial Number (ex. DFOWQLSGH8K)
Requires Board-ID (ex. Mac-D859C5498DA9EE9D) 

## TODO
Install BCM943602CS PCI-E WIFI/BT card when it arrives

Map the USB Ports in the proper way instead of injecting them all

Test HDMI Audio it should work but idk
